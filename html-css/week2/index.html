                <h3>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing
                    industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use
                    their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]</p>
                <p>There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
                    LAMP(Linux,Apache,MySQL,PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web
                    development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the
                    rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-developement software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
                    Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages
                    is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with
                    the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.</p>
                <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and
                    interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which
                    were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for
                    many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
                    rise of cloud services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of
                    being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>

                <h5>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h5>
                <p>
                    Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include
                    e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods
                    and
                    services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com(among many others) have transformed the
                    shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.
